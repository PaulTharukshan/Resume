<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<p> In my free time, I love engaging in activities that keep me both physically active and socially connected. Playing cricket is one of my favorite pastimes, as it not only challenges my skills and strategic thinking but also provides a great way to bond with friends over the game. I also enjoy going outside with friends, exploring new places, or just relaxing in nature, which helps me unwind and recharge. Additionally, playing computer games is a hobby that I find exciting and immersive, allowing me to dive into different worlds and experiences. These hobbies provide a perfect balance of relaxation, adventure, and camaraderie.</p>
